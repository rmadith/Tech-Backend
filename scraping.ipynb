       "('Carriers: act swiftly if you want to save the low-end smartphone - The Verge',\n",
       " 'For years, I\\'ve been talking about the effects of price pressure on the subsidized smartphone business -- the phenomenon that, when left unchecked, results in too many market segments squeezed into far too narrow of a price range. In turn, that leaves low-end devices priced right out of the market altogether. Of course, smartphones pervade every nook and cranny of your carrier\\'s lineup more completely nowadays than ever before, and I\\'ve found that it\\'s leading to some truly strange pricing problems.\\n\\nThat was really driven home for me today when I took a look at the first page of of Android devices on T-Mobile\\'s online store. In the span of just $50, you range all the way from the lowly Comet -- sourced from Huawei with a QVGA display -- up to the relatively powerful, capable, and competent myTouch 4G with HSPA+ and a front-facing cam. Granted, the myTouch is refurbished, but you\\'ve still got access to the Optimus T and myTouch 3G for free -- and both of those devices are head and shoulders above the Comet, Charm, CLIQ, or CLIQ XT. Every one of those currently go for $0 on contract. And when you look at the total cost of ownership over the span of a two-year commitment, the difference in cost between a free device and a $50 one is all but meaningless.\\n\\nIt\\'s like your realtor showing you two homes: a one-bedroom shack with a leaky roof for $100,000, or an eight-bedroom mansion with a pool for $110,000, both with the same maintenance costs over time (far-fetched, I know, but stay with me on the analogy). Which would you choose? Even if you had to stretch a little bit, you\\'d obviously aim for the mansion. And what\\'s especially troubling is that for your average consumer, the difference in quality and capability between a Comet and an Optimus T is far less obvious than the difference between a shack and a mansion at the point of purchase. In fact, I\\'d argue that the obscurity is the one and only reason devices like the Comet have a market right now.\\n\\nSo far, American carriers seem reluctant to deal with it, but here\\'s the thing: the answer doesn\\'t simply have to be for low-end smartphones to go away. Not everyone needs an iPhone, an Atrix, or a G2x, but it is the responsibility of the carriers to reward their customers appropriately for choosing cheaper devices upfront. That\\'s the place where they\\'re failing. I think there are a couple possible options on the table:\\n\\n*  Low-end smartphones could be offered with cheaper, exclusive plans. T-Mobile tried this with the Nokia Nuron, which could be activated with a relatively cheap $10 unlimited data plan typically reserved for dumbphones. Over the course of your contract, the benefits really start to add up -- and I bet that carriers\\' internal stats support my belief that owners of devices like the Comet use significantly less data than owners of midrange and high-end devices (those in the $100 to $300 range). The downside is that there would be a constant barrage of controversial gray areas about what phones should be eligible for the cheaper plans... and plus, as devices get cheaper over time, you\\'d need to decide whether to make them eligible midstream. Pretty hairy.\\n*  More creative subsidies. Right now, there seems to be an implicit understanding that the floor is $0 on contract. But why? If the Optimus T is free, I think you can make the argument that the Comet is worth about $-50, so either pay the buyer upfront (say, with a prepaid card) or -- probably the more compelling and manageable option -- offer a bill credit. So, for example, if you buy the Comet, you pay nothing upfront and the first $50 worth of service would be covered. Sprint ran a promotion recently that involved bill credits, so I know for a fact these carriers have the technical capability to manage an option like this.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that the price pressure phenomenon is entirely artificial and ends up short-changing bargain shoppers who deal with an enormous range of quality in the span of a couple $20 bills when they walk into the store. As with any product, you should be able to figure out very quickly how capable a product is by its relative pricing -- and in an age where even $250 is \"pushing it\" for a high-end model on contract, these guys are going to need to get creative.\\n')"

       " 'Elon Musk has shared a new video on Saturday featuring Optimus, the robot Tesla has been working on since 2021. But anyone who tries to watch the video will immediately notice something weird. The clip of Optimus is so low quality and pixelated that it looks like it was shot on a flip-phone from two decades ago.\\n\\n\\nThe new video was posted in the early morning hours of Saturday and has been viewed over 35 million times as of this writing. But the video appears to show Optimus just walking around without doing much of anything. That would have been quite impressive around 2013 or so, since it’s relatively difficult to get machines to walk like humans, but it’s not entirely clear why Musk would want the world to see Optimus walking like this.\\n\\nIncremental technical achievements aside, why does this video look so terrible? We weren’t the only ones to notice the bizarrely pixelated quality, as plenty of Musk fans made jokes about the blurriness.\\n\\n“Was this filmed with a potato?” one user quipped.\\n\\n“Same photographer?” another X user quipped with a photo of Bigfoot.\\n\\n\\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to questions about this new video of Optimus emailed Saturday.\\n\\nMusk unveiled Optimus with an unconventional presentation in the summer of 2021 that really felt like the billionaire was desperate to hype virtually anything futuristic. Tesla’s AI Day that year didn’t feature a real robot, but rather someone dressed in a white and black suit moving around like a stereotypical robot before starting to dance a jig.\\n\\nTesla’s robot has made progress since that first jokey unveiling, but Optimus still has quite a ways to go before it can catch up to the most cutting edge robots of the 2020s. Atlas, a humanoid robot made by Boston Dynamics, started learning how to pick itself up in 2016, standing on one leg that same year, doing backflips in 2017, and achieved parkour-style jumping in 2018. \\n\\nAnd Atlas is still making progress in ways that rival how humans actually move. Last year, the Atlas robot showed off its ability to manipulate its environment to navigate complex worksites.\\n\\n\\nOptimus has made improvements since it was first announced but it has quite a ways to go if it wants to catch up to a company like Boston Dynamics. Arguably the most impressive thing we’ve seen Optimus do is fold laundry, but if you take a close look at the video, there was a person standing just off-screen mimicking the movements. And, frankly, that’s technology that’s been possible since the 1960s.\\n\\nCan Tesla develop a truly autonomous robot that can work as a household servant, just as Musk has promised? Only time will tell. But we’ve been waiting on that version of the future for over a century now. Robotics is hard. But we can certainly keep dreaming.\\n\\n\\n')"

       " \"Prices range widely for standing desks, but you can find a great one to suit your needs at almost any budget. As noted above, the Latitude Run Amilcar and Ikea Trotten Standing Desk were my favorite options under $300.</p> Make sure you have enough space for your standing desk before you make your purchase. Don't just consider the room it's going in, either. Also think about the doors, stairwells and other places the box must pass through. It might fit in your planned office space, but if you can't get it up your third-floor walk-up, you'll be in trouble.</p> All adjustable-height desks have a low and a high range for sitting and standing, but the height adjustment ranges aren't universal across different styles and brands. If you're on the shorter or taller end, certain models might not be comfortable for you, so check the specs beforehand to determine if you'll be comfortable using the desk, both sitting and standing.&nbsp;</p> Electric standing desks cost more than manual desks, so your budget will absolutely come into play here, but there's more to consider. Manual desks, which have pneumatic pedals, hand cranks or other manual controls, are lighter and quieter (because there's no heavy, noise-making motor mounted under your desk). Manual desks also don't require proximity to an outlet to work. Electric desks allow for easy raising and lowering with the press of a button; some even have digital height readouts so you can always return your desk to the exact same sitting or standing height settings.&nbsp;</p>\")"
